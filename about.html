        <h2>About The Game</h2>
        <p>Match MK is a memory match game based on the hit fighting game Mortal Kombat. As a kid I would play this
            game for hours on end against my friends and thought it would be a great idea to create a memory game in
        honor of the great memories I have from playing each addition. To play click
